# Polymorphism = Greek work that means to "have many forms or faces"

#               TWO WAYS TO ACHIEVE POLYMORPHISM
#               1. Inheritance = An object could be treated of the same type as a parent class
#               2. "Duck typing" = Object must have necessary attributes/methods

# Below theres a example of inheritance as polymorphism.
# Circle can be a Circle and a Shape, Square can be a Square and a Shape and Triangle as well.
# They both has 2 faces or 2 forms
